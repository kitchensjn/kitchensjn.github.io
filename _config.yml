  Hi, my name is James. I am a recent graduate of Warren Wilson College in Asheville, North Carolina where I earned a BS in Biology and a BS in Chemistry. Throughout college and high school, I developed my interests and skills in the areas of conservation genetics, human genomics, and statistical modeling. I have worked on project focused on water resource management and conservation species monitoring. I enjoy creative programming and data visaulization, including developing application in <mark>Python</mark> and <mark>Shiny</mark>.
  
  In January 2020, I moved to Pomona, California from Virginia and am excited to explore the West Coast.
