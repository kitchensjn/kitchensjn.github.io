  Hi, my name is James. I recently graduated from Warren Wilson College in Asheville, North Carolina, earning a BS in Biology and a BS in Chemistry. Throughout college and high school, I developed interests and skills in conservation genetics, human genomics, and statistical modeling. I enjoy creative programming and data visualizations, including developing applications in <mark>Python</mark> and <mark>Shiny</mark>.
  
  In January 2020, I moved to from Virginia to Pomona, California. I am excited to explore the West Coast!
