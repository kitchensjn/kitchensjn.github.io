# Personal Website

This repository contains the code and files associated with my personal website at [james-kitchens.com](https://www.james-kitchens.com) This website is built through mostly custom code that I hope to build out into a template.

If you like my homepage, check out my [tutorial](https://www.james-kitchens.com/blog/animated-website-background) about how to create it yourself, or dive straight into the [code](https://github.com/kitchensjn/animated-website-background).
