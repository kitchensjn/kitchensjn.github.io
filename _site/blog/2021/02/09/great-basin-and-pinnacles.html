<p>Over the last few months, Margaret and I have visited two new US national parks, Great Basin in Nevada and Pinnacles in California. These two parks are smaller and less visited than some others that are nearby, but are full of really nice hiking trails and photogenic terrain.</p>

<h3 id="great-basin">Great Basin</h3>

<p>Located in remote eastern Nevada, Great Basin National Park is centered around Wheeler Peak, a 13,000 foot mountain that towers over the surrounding landscape. This peak is the second highest in Nevada and generates its own weather patterns, allowing for a diverse alpine forest reprieve from the dry Nevada high desert. Great Basin also contains groves of bristlecone pines, one of the oldest species in the world and, more importantly, my favorite tree.</p>

<p>The park is accessible from the east side, with Salt Lake City, Utah being the closest big city.</p>

<p>During our visit, we took Wheeler Peak Scenic Drive up to the Wheeler Peak parking area. There are a few smaller trails in this region that connect Stella Lake and Teresa Lake as well as head all of the way up to the top of Wheeler Peak. The top photo for this post is of Stella Lake with Wheeler Peak up and to the right in the background.</p>

<p>There are two options for food around the park; the Lehman Caves Visitor Center and the small town of Baker. Both have relatively sparse options beyond pizza or burgers, so it is best to pack in what you will want while visiting. If you plan to camp outside of the park, there is Bureau of Land Management land to the north of the park at Sacramento Pass. When we stayed there, the front parking lot was pretty full, so we drove further in to find a more secluded place (there was plenty of room).</p>
