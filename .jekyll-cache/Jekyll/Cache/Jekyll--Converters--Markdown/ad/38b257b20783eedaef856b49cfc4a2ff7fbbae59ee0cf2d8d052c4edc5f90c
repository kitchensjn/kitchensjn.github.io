I"ê<p>Hi, my name is James Kitchens, and I am a first year graduate student studying population genetics in the <a href="https://gcbias.org">Coop Lab</a> through the UC Davis Population Graduate Group. Before graduate school, I interned at NASAâ€™s Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, California, researching the application of remote sensing for groundwater observation and management. In December 2019, I graduated from Warren Wilson College in Asheville, North Carolina, where I earned a B.S. in Biology and B.S. in Chemistry. While in undergraduate, I worked in the Warren Wilson College Plant Physiology and Genetics Laboratory as a Research Assistant on projects focused around the conservation of human-impacted species in the United States.</p>
