<p>A few years ago, Andrew Graham asked me to help him develop a digital dashboard for his motorcycles (check out his company, <a href="https://tridentcycles.blog">Trident Cycles</a>) that would record his laps around the track during races. I spent a summer toiling over various Arduino components trying to build out a prototype but was not particularly successful. After building relevant skills during the development of other recent projects, I decided to try my hand again at working on a functional prototype. This post documents my thought process and findings while working through Trident, a web-based motorcycle trip recorder.</p>

<h3 id="concept">Concept</h3>

<p>I wanted to design Trident similarly to a preexisting and popular workout application, <a href="https://www.strava.com">Strava</a>. Users will be able to record trips, view recordings that display post-processed visualizations generated from the data, and share those recordings with others. Iâ€™m hoping to keep the scope of the project much smaller than a true clone of Strava, which includes user interactions (follows, likes, and comments). Instead, I have decided to focus on the data processing in order to pull the most interesting information from the combination of phone sensors. At the moment, these sensors include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>GPS</li>
  <li>Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) - accelerometer and gyroscope</li>
</ul>

<p>Individually, the sensors have their strengths and weaknesses. The GPS provides absolute positioning and speed but is limited to a slow refresh rate of 1Hz. This greatly limits its effectiveness when tracking a motorcycle through a turn during a race. In contrast, the IMU has a very quick refresh rate but only provides relative measurements. By combining these sensors, I hope to generate an expected position that fills in the gaps between the observed positions.</p>

<p>But before I can get to working through the processing steps, I needed to build a stable method for creating, storing, and viewing trip recordings.</p>
