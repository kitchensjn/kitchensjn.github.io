<p>A few years ago, Andrew Graham asked me to help him develop a digital dashboard for his motorcycles (check out his company, <a href="https://tridentcycles.blog">Trident Cycles</a>) that would record his laps around the track during races. I spent a summer toiling over various Arduino components trying to build out a prototype but was not particularly successful. After building relevant skills during the development of other recent projects, I decided to try my hand again at working on a functional prototype. This post documents my thought process and findings while working through</p>
