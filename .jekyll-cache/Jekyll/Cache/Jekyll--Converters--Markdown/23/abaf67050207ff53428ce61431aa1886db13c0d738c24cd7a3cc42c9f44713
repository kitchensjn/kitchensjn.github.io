I"	<p>I really like when I get to see clear progress in my programming abilities. When I first created this website, I had relatively little experience with website design, so I was drawing a lot of code and inspiration from YouTube tutorials and Stack Overflow. There are a few aspects of the website that I would categorize as ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù, falling so perfectly at the intersection of annoyance and complacency that they will likely never be updated. But there was one particular issue that has always bothered me‚Ä¶ the blog post thumbnail images.</p>

<p>The blog post cards consist of a thumbnail and an information section, including title, date, short description, and categories. These thumbnails are meant to give users a look at a projects and break up the text blocks. The information section has a variable height, depending on the length of the content inside. The thumbnail image then fills the rest of the card; I scale the image up to fully cover the available space within the div. Up to today, an outline of my method for handling this was as follows:</p>

<p class="codeheader">blog.html</p>
<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"card"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"postimg"</span> <span class="na">style=</span><span class="s">"background-image: url('')"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"info"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">""</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"overlay"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
            <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">style=</span><span class="s">"position: absolute; top: 50%; left: 50%; transform: translate(-50%, -50%); font-size: 6em; color: #FFFFFF;"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
                <span class="nt">&lt;i</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"fas fa-book-open"</span> <span class="na">title=</span><span class="s">"Website"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</span>
            <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
