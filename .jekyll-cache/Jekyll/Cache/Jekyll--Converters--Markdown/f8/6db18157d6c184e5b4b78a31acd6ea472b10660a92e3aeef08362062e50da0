I"ê<p>A key insight from human genetics is that, as a species, we are all very genetically similar and share much of our genetic variation. Two humans picked at random are identical at 99.9% of sites in their genomes and much of the genetic variation there is shared among human groups. These subtle differences between individuals and groups highlight a history of shared ancient history and migration that human geneticists are interested in unraveling, but understanding and visualizing patterns of human genetic variation is often challenging due to the complexity of data involved. One helpful place to start is to visualize the global frequencies of variants at individual sites within the genome (check out the <a href="https://popgen.uchicago.edu/ggv/?data=%221000genomes%22&amp;chr=1&amp;pos=222087833">Geography of Genetic Variants Browser</a> from the Novembre Lab for a nice interactive tool) to see how variation is shared. However, the human genome contains approximately 3 billion sites, it would take a few lifetimes to view all of the variants in this manner, so researchers often turn to genome-wide summary statistics to capture overall patterns of genetic variation.</p>

<p>We wanted to share some resources we‚Äôve been putting together for teaching genetics (inspired by <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.21506">Donovan et al. 2019</a> and <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/60107">Biddanda et al. 2020</a>). These visualizations first center on the variation in a set of diverse samples from the Americas that were sequenced as part of the 1000 Genomes Project before expanding to include more globally distributed examples.</p>

<p>The number of genomic sites that individuals vary at is a small fraction of their entire sequenced genomes. Within this variation, the vast majority of variable sites have no known function; carrying a G instead of an A may have no discernible effect on your traits. Most of this variation is rare; for example, a single person might carry an A at a particular location in the genome where everyone else has a C. These rare variants are interesting for other applications but are the properties of particular people and their immediate families, not the human group that they come from. Following Biddanda et al. 2020, we defined a variant as ‚Äúcommon‚Äù in a sample if it was found in more than 5% of individuals and then filtered the data based on this criteria.</p>

<p>The small blue circle in the above figure captures just how little variation rises to this frequency in the Americas. As the rest of this post focuses on these common variants, it‚Äôs important to maintain perspective regarding the scale of these differences relative to the size of the human genome.</p>

<p>There are seven samples located in the Americas. To understand how this variation is shared among samples in the Americas, we counted the number of common variants found in each sample.</p>
