    The TopoTable Project seeks to build a dynamic 3D topographic relief table that is built with moveable pillars. Rather than being constrained to a single region, the motors within the TopoTable would all it to shift from one map to the next. I have worked to develop the user interface for downloading and processing elevation data using <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>R</mark>, <mark>Leaflet</mark> and <mark>Shiny</mark>. This application is hosted through <mark>shinyapps.io</mark>.

    In October 2019, Dr. Paul Bartels asked if I could develop a <mark>Shiny</mark> application that would display agregated marine tardigrade findings from Kaczmarek, L., Bartels, P.J., Roszkowska, M. & Nelson, D. (2015). The Zoogeography of Marine Tardigrada, *Zootaxa* 4037:1-189. Using <mark>R</mark>, this application accesses data through the Google Sheets API, allowing for quick updating without the need for a full redeploy. Findings are then displayed within a <mark>Leaflet</mark> map. This application is hosted through <mark>shinyapps.io</mark>.
