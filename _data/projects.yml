    This project seeks to build a dynamic 3D topographic relief table that is built with moveable pillars. Rather than being constrained to a single region, the motors within the TopoTable would all it to shift from one map to the next. A more in depth discussion of the project and its goals can be found at [here](jkitchensf16.shinyapps.io/topotable).
