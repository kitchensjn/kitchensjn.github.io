    Over the past 20 years, California has experienced a number of droughts that affect the security of critical groundwater reserves. California's Central Valley is one of the most productive agricultural regions of the United States, producing approximately $20 billion in crops annually. Through a collaboration California's Department of Water Resources, California State University - Los Angeles, and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the team is testing the feasibility of using <mark>Remote Sensing</mark> datasets to supplement in-situ well and GPS measurements for the purpose of measuring groundwater storage changes in within the Central Valley. Modelling is being performed in <mark>Python</mark> and <mark>R</mark>. We are currently developing a <mark>Shiny</mark> application (VIRGO) that will be provided to Groundwater Sustainability Agency Managers to aid in assessment of current conditions and trends.

    The TopoTable Project seeks to build a dynamic 3D topographic relief table that is built with moveable pillars. Rather than being constrained to a single region, the motors within the TopoTable would allow it to shift from one map to the next. I have worked to develop the user interface for downloading and processing elevation data using <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>R</mark>, <mark>Leaflet</mark> and <mark>Shiny</mark>. This application is hosted through <mark>shinyapps.io</mark>.

    In October 2019, Dr. Paul Bartels and I collaborated to develop a <mark>Shiny</mark> application that would display agregated marine tardigrade findings from [Kaczmarek, L., Bartels, P.J., Roszkowska, M. & Nelson, D. (2015). The Zoogeography of Marine Tardigrada, *Zootaxa* 4037:1-189](https://www.biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.4037.1.1){:target="_blank"}. Using <mark>R</mark>, this application accesses data through the Google Sheets API, allowing for quick updating without the need for a full redeploy. Findings are then displayed within a <mark>Leaflet</mark> map, hosted through <mark>shinyapps.io</mark>.
