    During Summer 2019, I worked as a Research Intern during an eight week long summer term at Arizona State University. The first four weeks of the program included guest lectures on complex mathematical topics and their application to biological reseach. The last four weeks surrounded the development of an original research project. I was the creator and team lead for a team studying the Topography and Behavior Based Movement Modeling for Missing Hikers in Land-Wilderness Settings, including the development of <mark>Cellular Automata</mark> simulations in <mark>Python</mark>.

    I managed a dataset of over 6000 individuals who participated in the Spit for Science Project at Virginia Commonwealth University. More information on the Spit for Science Project can be found [here](https://spit4science.vcu.edu). I wrote programs in Python to generate phenotypic risk scores for individuals based on single nucleotide polymorphism and performed quality control of statistical analysis processes as part of a larger research team.
