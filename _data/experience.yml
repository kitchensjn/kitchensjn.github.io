    Through a collaboration between the California Department of Water Resources, California State University - Los Angeles, and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, my project team tested the feasibility of using <mark>Remote Sensing</mark> datasets to supplement *in-situ* well and GPS measurements for the purpose of quantifying groundwater storage changes in the Central Valley. Modeling was performed in <mark>Python</mark> and <mark>R</mark>. We started development of a <mark>Shiny</mark> application (VIRGO) to aid Groundwater Sustainability Agency managers in their assessment of current conditions and trends.

    While at Warren Wilson College, I worked as a research assistant within Dr. Alisa Hove's laboratory, where we studied human-impacted species, including the American pika (*Ochotona princeps*) and American ginseng (*Panax quinquefolius*). My capstone project was a genetic sex ratio analysis of American pika populations found in the Rocky Mountain Region. Working with samples collected by partners at University of Colorado Boulder, I created a protocol for <mark>DNA Extraction and Quantification</mark> from pika hair, tissue, and scat samples. Preliminary findings suggested that there was a slight male bias across our samples. Continued observation and further testing are still needed to determine if this bias is apparent within the population or due to inadvertent effects of the sampling methodology. Through work in the lab, I advanced my skills in <mark>PCR</mark>, <mark>Gel Electrophoresis</mark>, <mark>NMR Spectroscopy</mark>, <mark>Field Sampling</mark> and <mark>Phenological Monitoring</mark>.

    I worked as a research intern during an eight week summer term at Arizona State University. The first four weeks of the program included guest lectures on complex mathematical topics and their application to biological research. The last four weeks focused on the development of an original research project. I was the creator and lead for a team studying the Topography and Behavior Based Movement Modeling for Missing Hikers in Land-Wilderness Settings, including the development of <mark>Cellular Automata</mark> simulations in <mark>Python</mark>. We analyzed how certain terrain features generate natural bottlenecking effects, which may funnel a lost hiker in more predictable directions. Knowledge of these effects could potentially aid in efficient search efforts across terrain that is less familiar to search and rescue teams.

    Paired with professors from UW - La Crosse and members of the United States Geological Survey, I used <mark>Environmental DNA</mark> data to model population size of an invasive species (*Petromyzon marinus*) within the Great Lakes. A graduate student at the university had previously collected the data, which included sample extraction and quantitative PCR measurements. I developed models in <mark>R</mark> to analyze both copy number measurements and presence/absence observations. I found that environmental DNA was strongly correlated with population size in a very controlled setting, such as a pool, but had limited use beyond presence/absence detection when utilized in a natural setting due to the more complex system of compounding factors. Through this project, I gained experience in <mark>Statistical Programming</mark>.

    I managed a database of over 6000 individuals who participated in the "[Spit for Science Project](https://spit4science.vcu.edu){:target="_blank"}" at Virginia Commonwealth University. I wrote programs in <mark>Python</mark> and <mark>SQLite</mark> to query the database and create summary statistics tables describing the available data. These tables included quality control measurements and were used to generate phenotypic risk scores for individuals based on their combination of single nucleotide polymorphisms. With the support of this work, I coauthored [Webb et al. (2017). Molecular Genetic Influences on Normative and Problematic Alcohol Use in a Population-Based Sample of College Students. Frontiers in Genetics, 8](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2017.00030/full){:target="_blank"}, where we identified two DNA markers that were significantly associated with alcohol consumption behaviors.
