    Through a collaboration between the California Department of Water Resources, California State University - Los Angeles, and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the team tested the feasibility of using <mark>Remote Sensing</mark> datasets to supplement in-situ well and GPS measurements for the purpose of measuring groundwater storage changes in within the Central Valley. Modeling was performed in <mark>Python</mark> and <mark>R</mark>. We began the development of a <mark>Shiny</mark> application (VIRGO) that will be provided to Groundwater Sustainability Agency managers to aid in assessment of current conditions and trends.

    While at Warren Wilson College, I worked as a research assistant within Dr. Alisa Hove's research laboratory, where we studied human-impacted species, including the American pika (*Ochotona princeps*) and American ginseng (*Panax quinquefolius*). My capstone project was a genetic sex ratio analysis of American pika populations found in the Rocky Mountain Region. Working with samples collected by partners at University of Colorado Boulder, I created a protocol for <mark>DNA Extraction and Quantification</mark> from pika hair, tissue, and scat samples. Preliminary findings suggested that there was a slight male bias across our samples. Continued observation and further testing is still needed to determine if this bias is apparent within the population or due to inadvertent effects of the sampling methodology. Through my work in the lab, I advanced my skills in <mark>PCR</mark>, <mark>Gel Electrophoresis</mark>, <mark>NMR Spectroscopy</mark>, <mark>Field Sampling</mark> and <mark>Phenological Monitoring</mark>.

    During Summer 2019, I worked as a research intern during an eight week long summer term at Arizona State University. The first four weeks of the program included guest lectures on complex mathematical topics and their application to biological research. The last four weeks focused on the development of an original research project. I was the creator and lead for a team studying the Topography and Behavior Based Movement Modeling for Missing Hikers in Land-Wilderness Settings, including the development of <mark>Cellular Automata</mark> simulations in <mark>Python</mark>. We analyzed how certain terrain features generate natural bottlenecking effects, which may funnel a lost hiker in more predictable directions. Knowledge of these effects could potentially aid in efficient search efforts across terrain that is less familiar to Search And Rescue teams.

    Paired with professors from UW - La Crosse and members of the United States Geological Survey, I used environmental DNA data to model population size of an invasive species (*Petromyzon marinus*) within the Great Lakes. Data had been previously collected by a graduate student at the university, including sample extraction and quanititative PCR. I developed models in <mark>R</mark> to analyze both copy number measurements and presence/absence observations. I found that environmental DNA was strongly correlated with population size in a very controlled setting, such as a pool), but had limited use beyond presence/absence detection when utilized in a natural setting due to the more complex system of compounding factors. Through this project, I greatly expanded my understanding of statistical programming.

    I managed a database of over 6000 individuals who participated in the Spit for Science Project at Virginia Commonwealth University. More information on the Spit for Science Project can be found [here](https://spit4science.vcu.edu){:target="_blank"}. I wrote programs in <mark>Python</mark> and <mark>SQLite</mark> to query the database and generate phenotypic risk scores for individuals based on single nucleotide polymorphism and performed quality control of statistical analysis processes as part of a larger research team. This work culminated in coauthorship of [Webb et al. (2017). Molecular Genetic Influences on Normative and Problematic Alcohol Use in a Population-Based Sample of College Students. Frontiers in Genetics, 8](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2017.00030/full){:target="_blank"} where we identified two DNA markers that were significantly associated with alcohol consumption behaviors.
