    During my time at Warren Wilson College, I developed an excitement for research focused around the conservation of at-risk populations and resources. I worked for three years in Dr. Alisa Hove's Genetics and Plant Physiology Research Laboratory, studying the population genetics of human impacted species (*Ochotona princeps* and *Panax quinquefolius*). Through my work in the lab, I advanced my skills in <mark>DNA Extraction and Quantification</mark>, <mark>PCR</mark>, <mark>Gel Electrophoresis</mark>, <mark>Sampling</mark> and <mark>Phenological Monitoring</mark>.
    I also volunteered in the WWC Creative Technologies Laboratory, assisting students with <mark>3D Printing</mark> and establishing an understanding of basic <mark>CNC Router</mark> function.
