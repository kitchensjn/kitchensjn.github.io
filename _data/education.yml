    During my time at Warren Wilson College, I worked for three years in Dr. Alisa Hove's Genetics and Plant Physiology Research Laboratory, studying the population genetics of human impacted species (*Ochotona princeps* and *Panax quinquefolius*). I developed wet laboratory skills including <mark>DNA Extraction and Quantification</mark>, <mark>PCR</mark>, and <mark>Gel Electrophoresis</mark>.
