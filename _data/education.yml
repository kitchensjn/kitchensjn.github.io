    During my time at Warren Wilson College, I developed an excitement for research focused around the conservation of at-risk populations and resources. I worked for three years in Dr. Alisa Hove's Genetics and Plant Physiology Research Laboratory, studying the population genetics of human impacted species (*Ochotona princeps* and *Panax quinquefolius*).
    
    I volunteered in the WWC Creative Technologies Laboratory, assisting students with <mark>3D Printing</mark> and establishing a protocol for basic 3-axis <mark>CNC Router</mark> function. I continued to push myself to learn new and creative methods in data visualization in <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>R</mark>, and <mark>GIS</mark>.

    I also volunteered with Bounty and Soul, a local food pantry based out of Black Mountain, North Carolina. While there, I helped run the weekly markets, where we redistributed food donated by various businesses to members of the community. Black Mountain has a prominent Latinx community, and I assisted in translating recipes and questionnaires into <mark>Spanish</mark> to ensure that all individuals could benefit and be heard.
